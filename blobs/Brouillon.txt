init:
	Each player has 15~30 blobs (same number for each player)
	Each player order his waiting blobs
	
turn:	
	Each player take the firsts waiting blobs to have 5 in his hand
	Each player choose blobs from his hand to join battlefield, in order to have 3 blobs in the battle
	All choosen blobs of all players appear on the battlefield at the same time
	
	Players choose at the same time for all their blobs to activate or not it active effect
	Effects are shown
	
	All players at the same time choose their blobs actions (without been shown to other player)
	Actions:
		- Select 1 or more blobs to attack. Select 1 or more foes blobs to taget.
			Att force = Sum of attacking blobs 'Attack' divided by targetted blobs number
			For each targetted blobs:
				[Damages without def bonus] = [Att force] - [blob defense]
				[Damages] = [Damages without def bonus] - [blob defense bonus]
				Blob's life -= Damages (if not negative)
				
				(computing [%defensive bonus] = [blob defense bonus]
		
		- Select 1 or more blobs to defend. Select 1 or more ally blobs to target. (targets can be defenders too)
			Def force = {Sum of defending blobs 'Defense'] รท ([targetted blobs number] + [defending blobs numbers]) 
																	[a defending and targetted blob will count 2 times]
			For each targetted blobs:
				Blob defense bonus += Def force
			For defending blobs:
				Blob defense bonus += Def force
		
	All action simultaneously solved (not depending on order or who is killed or not)
	
	After actions solved:
	all Blob defense bonus set to 0
	
	Each blobs has Live <=0 is removed from the battlefield
	Each blobs remaining on battlefield and players earn xp
		(att) xp += {Sum for each attacked foe of [reduced live]รท[total live]} รท [Number of attacking blobs]
		(def) xp += {Sum for each defended ally of [reduced live]รท[total live]}

	If a player's who loose blobls has his waiting blob's queue empty, end game. 
	Else nextTurn;

end:
	Player who have more blobs left (sum battlefields, hands and waitings blobs) win
