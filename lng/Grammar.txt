Notation:
-------------------

All words starts with uppercase letter, and after are composed by lowercase letters.
All particles starts with uppercase letter, and after are composed by lowercase letters.
All groups starts with an open parenthesis before the group-begin, and finishes with a closen parenthesis after group-end.
A dot separate sentenses.


Sentence:
-------------------

Composed of Verbs and Groups.
Note that verbs can be nouns, adjectives (passive mode), or verbs.
Note also that groups are typically sub-sentences used like verbs.



Groups and Particles with arguments:
-------------------

Group: (can be used as enumeration)
  <group-begin> + Verb/Group + Verb/Group + ... + <group-begin> + <group-end> 

Particles with arguments:  (Like a group, but replacing <group-begin> with the particle)
  Particle + Verb/Group + Verb/Group + ... + Particle + <group-end>


Particle are for example:
of, according to, during, from, to, while, ...


(Cat; food + active; while; Mouse; food + passive; while + endGroup)
Cat is eating while Mouse is being eaten.

(Mouse; food + passive). (Cat; food + active; while; <implicit>).
Mouse is being eaten. Cat is eating while (that was said in last sentence).

Example with more than 1 argument:
There is a dog, a big cat and a mouse.
(And; (dog, <group> + (Cat; big) + <group> + endGroup, mouse) + And + endGroup).


When having groups of groups, doubleing the group can be used to avoid confusion with enclosing group:
Engl: a and b and (c or d or (e and f) or g or h) and i and j.
Meta: (And, a, b, (Or, c,  d, (And², e,  f, And² + <endgroup>), g, h, Or + endGroup), i, j, And + endGroup).
Actu: (To <a> <b> (Ta <c> <d> (ToTo <e> <f> TotoNe) <g> <h> TaNe) <i> <j> ToNe).

Repeating the group-start particle between elements is also possible to easier remembering of the struture.
Engl: a and b and (c or d) and e and f.
Meta: (And, a, b, (Or, c,  d, Or + endGroup), And, e, f, And + endGroup).
Actu: (To <a> <b> (Ta <c> <d> TaNe) To <e> <f> ToNe).



Verbs:
-------------------

1- Noun
Example with Subject: Cat, Action: Eat

2- Relativity
Nominative: 'Food'     > No particle (often translate nouns)
Active: 'to Eat'       > -Ka         (often translate verbs)
Passive: 'to be Eaten' > -Pa         (often translate adjectives)
Active and passive: 'to and to be eaten' > -KaPa

3- Mode
Affirmative: Cat eat               > No particle
Negative: Cat do not eat           > -Nò
Imperative: Cat should eat         > -Mi
Conditional: Cat may eat           > -Ki  (unknown or good chance (50% > 80%) for affirmative equivalent)
Interrogative: Is the cat eating ? > -Zè

--Modes can be combinated:
 Negative + Conditional:    Cat (may not) eat     > -Nòki   (estimated low chance (0% > 20%) for affirmative equivalent)
 Conditional + Negative:    Cat may (not eat)     > -Kinò   (estimated bad chance (20% > 49%) for affirmative equivalent)
 Neg. + Conditional + Neg.: Cat may not (not eat) > -Nòkinò (estimated high chance (80% > 100%) for affirmative equivelent)

 Negative + Imperative:    Cat (should not) eat > -Nòmi
 Imperative + Negative:	   Cat should (not eat) > -Minò
 Conditional + Imperative: Cat may have to eat  > -Kimi
 Negative + Imperative + Negative:    Cat (should not) (not eat)    > -Nòminò
 Negative + Conditional + Imperative: Cat may have to (not eat) > -Nòkimi
 Conditional + Negative + Imperative: Cat (may not) (have to eat) > -Kinòmi
 Conditional + Imperative + Negative: Cat may (not have to eat) > -Kiminò
 Negative + Conditional + Imperative + Negative: Cat may (not have to (not eat)) > -Nòkiminò
 Conditional + Negative + Imperative + Negative: Cat may not (not have to eat)   > -Kinòminò
 Negative + Conditional + Negative + Imperative: Cat may not (have to (not eat)) > -Nòkinòmi
 Negative + Conditional + Negative + Imperative + Negative: Cat may not (not have to (not eat)) > -Nòkinòminò

4- Tempse
None/General: Cat eat > No particle
Past: Cat was eating  > -Sù
Future: Cat will eat  > -Fù
Past progressive: <not in english>   > -Zù   (has started in the past, is finishing now or in the future (no information))
Present Progressive: Cat is eating   > -Zùvù (has started in the past, and will finish in the future)
Future progressive: <not in english> > -Vù   (will finish in the future, is beginning or has begun in the past (no information))

Tempses are combinable. First tempse used is stronger, last is weak.
Past + Future (Future in the past): Cat was going to eat > -Sùfù
Future + Past (Past in the furute): Cat will have eaten  > -Fùsù
Past + Past (Past in the past): Cat had eaten            > -Sùsù
Past + Present Progressive: The cat was eating           > -Sùzùvù
Past + Future + Past (Before future in the past): The cat was going to have eaten > -Sùfùsù
Past + Future + Future Progressive: The cat was going to be eating                > -Sùfùzù
Past + Future + Past Progressive: The cat was going to end to be eating           > -Sùfùvù

How to count things:
---------------------

Counting in base 6 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, ..., 15, 20, ..., 54, 55, 100, ...)
Single digit number said simply as the digit itself (as english)
	Engl: There is 2 persons
	Meta: Person, 2, Be + Passive
	Actu: <Person> Ke <Be>Pa

First saying the lower weight number, and last the heigher power one.
	Engl: 6              15      137
	Meta: 01 (0 + 1*6)   32      543 (5 + 4*6 + 3*6^2)
	Actu: Tcu Sa         Tù Ke   Po Tcu Mi

The word 'Xe' allows to count how many unsignifiant digits (or zeroes) there is in the number.
	Engl: 36 (100 in b6)   66 096 (1 230 000 in b6)
	Meta: 2 Xe 1           4 Xe 321  (4 zeroes and then 3, 2 and 1)
	Actu: Ke Xe Sa         Mi Xe Tù Ke Sa

The number before 'Xe' specifying the number of unsignifiant digits can also be a huge number, and so there can be a serie of 'Xe' for huge numbers
	Engl: ~1.26357x10^19   (= (4+2*6)x6^(5+3*6); in english notation of base 6: 24e^35)
	Meta: 53 Xe 42         ([5 and 3 as a number] zeroes after a 4 and a 2)
	Actu: Po Tù Xe Mi Ke

	Engl: <Huge> (= 5*(4*6^(3*6^(2*6)); in english notation of base 6: 5e^(4e^(3e^2))) )
	Meta: 2 Xe 3 Xe 4 Xe 5    ("[[2 zeroes after a 3] of zeroes after a 4] of zeroes after a 5")
	Actu: Ke Xe Tù Xe Mi Xe Po
