Sentence:
-------------------

Composed of Verbs and Groups.
Note that verbs can be nouns, adjectives (passive mode), or verbs.
Note also that groups are typically sub-sentences used like verbs.



Groups and Particles with arguments:
-------------------

Group: (can be used as enumeration)
  <group-begin> + Verb/Group + Verb/Group + ... + <group-begin> + <group-end> 

Particles with arguments:  (Like a group, but replacing <group-begin> with the particle)
  Particle + Verb/Group + Verb/Group + ... + Particle + <group-end>


Particle are for example:
of, according to, during, from, to, while, ...


(Cat; food + active; while; Mouse; food + passive; while + endGroup)
Cat is eating while Mouse is being eaten.

(Mouse; food + passive). (Cat; food + active; while; <implicit>).
Mouse is being eaten. Cat is eating while (that was said in last sentence).

Example with more than 1 argument:
There is a dog, a big cat and a mouse.
(And; (dog, <group> + (Cat; big) + <group> + endGroup, mouse) + And + endGroup).
